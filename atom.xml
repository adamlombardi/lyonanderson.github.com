    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft have released a typed superset of JavaScript called <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>. I spent a sizable portion of my life looking at types and JavaScript, in particular <a href="http://pubs.doc.ic.ac.uk/authors/cla97/">Inferring types for JavaScript programmes</a>. I still find the area interesting, and it&#8217;s nice to see this new and exciting work. I wonder if TypeScript has a sound type system? I see already that someone on Twitter has <a href="https://twitter.com/puffnfresh/statuses/252816990782230528">pointed out</a> that arrays are mutable and covariant:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was poking around in the iOS6 private frameworks over the weekend and found some interesting battery related stuff. I&#8217;ve put together a quick and dirty app which displays most of the interesting stuff. You can get it on github <a href="https://github.com/lyonanderson/BatteryInfo">here</a>. Being ever so fashionable I only support iOS6. Plus, it doesn&#8217;t work on iOS5!</p>

<p><img src="http://lyonanderson.github.com/images/IMG_4055.png" alt="Screenshot" /></p>

<p>Delving deeper, there is a class called OSDBattery which exposes battery metrics including the battery cycle count and serial number.  Looking at the <a href="https://github.com/nst/iOS-Runtime-Headers/">header dump</a> of iOS6 shows OSDBattery in the FactoryDiags framework. However, on device you won&#8217;t find this framework. Instead, you need to load the GAIA framework to use OSDBattery. So for example, to get the battery cycle count:</p>

<p>It goes without saying that you can&#8217;t submit an app using this code! It&#8217;s a private framework. Don&#8217;t be an idiot.  I&#8217;m not sure how useful all of this is. I&#8217;d quite like to run the app on a refurbished device to see what is says. I&#8217;m also not clear as to where exactly the count is stored i.e. in the battery or on device. Maybe the <a href="http://www.ifixit.com">iFixit</a> guys can swap batteries in a device and let me know?</p>

    <updated>2011-01-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://lyonanderson.github.com/blog/2011/01/09/2670466085</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There was a great <a title="discussion" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x7c36">discussion</a> on Radio 4 last week about freeing up National Rail Enquires (NRE) departure board data for developers to use. There were some great points made by both sides. But the whole thing was quite black and white and didn’t really go into the more delicate and interesting issues.  I often find in these discussions that people conflate a feed being publicly available and having permission to use that feed. They also conflate a feed with static data. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s great to have these discussions out in the open in a civilised and constructive manner.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>First, I&#8217;d like to make my background clear. In 2008 I worked for a company called Kizoom. Kizoom had been creating mobile applications, mobile websites and websites with train information for nearly 10 years. We&#8217;d had a long standing license with NRE to do this. In November 2008 I released MyRail Lite to the Apple AppStore. It displayed departure boards and calling patterns for UK trains. It was a moderate success and many people liked it. It was free too. We removed the application from the store in December 2008. I don&#8217;t want to go into the details of that here. It&#8217;s not really relevant to this discussion. However, I learnt many things from the episode. I learnt how to make iPhone applications. I learnt that business can be very personal. Personal in terms of making a connection with customers. Personal in terms of business relationships; both good and bad ones. MyRail Lite opened many doors and not long after I got to work on thetrainline&#8217;s iPhone application. Something I still do today. So on balance it was a great thing. It heartens me today that people still talk about it.</p>

<p>So, back to the National Rail Enquires data. To be honest, departure boards are not particularly interesting and the scope for doing exciting things is a little limited. It almost feels that once you&#8217;ve seen one departure board app, you&#8217;ve seen them all. [That&#8217;s a bit unfair, as the same does not seem to be true of Twitter clients]. I&#8217;m not saying you can&#8217;t do interesting things with departure board data, just that there is a far more exciting feed available.  As you may or may not be aware there is another way that NRE could give the data out to developers. Instead of the departure board, or pull feed as I shall call it, there is also a push feed. The push feed is like a fire hose (not sure what this means?) of train movements. As each train moves over sensors, periodically placed along the tracks, an event is generated (For more information see <a title="here" href="http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/rtti-decision-011209.pdf">here</a> [Page 9]). As you can imagine there are quite a lot of train movements. At Kizoom we saw the value of the push feed and built a really cool alerting engine with it. Internally we called it Clarence. On the outside we called it the Travel Angel. We could tell you when your train journey was going to be delayed via an SMS. We could even tell you when to get ready to change trains. We could do this because we knew where all the trains were. </p>

<p>Another more subtle advantage of the push feed is that it gives NRE better load independence with respect to the number of apps in the wild. Each app developer would be given a single push feed connection. It is then your job as a developer to handle the transformation of the feed into interesting information and scale appropriately. So if you want to build a departure board feed then you&#8217;ll have to handle the transformations and scalability yourself. NRE are protected as each developer only gets one push feed connection. With the current pull feed, each user of an application is making a connection to NRE&#8217;s servers.</p>

<p>Yes, it will be harder to work with. Yes, you won&#8217;t be able to simply plug your app into the feed and spit the data out. Yes, you&#8217;ll have to think about how you&#8217;re going to scale. But the rewards could be great. You could do things like infer problems on the lines, keep historical data and make pretty graphs. You could even create an alerting engine. You could analyse what happens to trains when the weather is bad. Maybe there are new ways to help commuters in these situations? Is it really helpful to tell people the next train is in 95 minutes from Waterloo? What does that really mean?</p>

<p>So to summarise, it&#8217;s great that NRE are giving out licences to the departure board feed. But what I&#8217;d really like to see is the push feed opened up. Because I believe that with the push feed we&#8217;ll really see what can be done with this data. Let&#8217;s aim higher and look beyond the departure board.</p>

    <updated>2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://lyonanderson.github.com/blog/2011/01/01/2557330270</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are some statistics for the year 2010 relating to me. Probably not that interesting, but here you go.</p>

<h2>Email</h2>

<p>My primary domain is lyonanderson.com. Most of my correspondence is via this account. I don&#8217;t include my work email here.<em> At work we recently moved to Lotus Notes so I suppose I no longer send email at work; we&#8217;ve to  call them &#8216;notes&#8217; instead. I don&#8217;t have any stats for that. I would imagine given the complexity of reading <strike>emails</strike> notes with Lotus Notes </em><em>getting statistics would almost be impossible. </em></p>

<p>Sent ~1400 messages (lyonanderson.com)<br/>Received ~6000 messages (lyonanderson.com)</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lecz28egyO1qawfwr.jpg"/></p>

<p>(The lower graph includes previous years, but I thought it was interesting to see how my email traffic is increasing year on year).</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2>SMS Usage</h2>

<p>So I&#8217;ve sent and received what I think is quite a large number of text messages. However, speaking to the yoof I had to revise this opinion. Kiddies today send this kind of traffic on a daily basis. </p>

<p>Sent: 3140 messages (35505 words)<br/>Received: 2965 message (42670 words) </p>

<p>Note I include &#8216;x&#8217; as a word. It&#8217;s pronounced Kiss or Kiss Kiss.  A kiss at the end of a SMS can make all the difference. Especially when sending SMSs to your boss.  </p>

<p>Without giving too much away, the following two graphics depict the kinds of words I send in my SMS messages. I have not included &#8216;x&#8217; in these pictures as no one wants to see a giant picture of an &#8216;x&#8217;.</p>

<p>Prominent words in outgoing SMS messages:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_leczettg1U1qawfwr.png"/></p>

<p>Prominent words in incoming SMS messages:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_leczg9j0Qr1qawfwr.png"/></p>

<h2>Twitter</h2>

<p>I posted 1021 twitter status updates.  I would have done a graphic for this too, but everyone seems to be doing that. </p>

<h2>Evernote</h2>

<p>I like <a title="Evernote" target="_blank" href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> a lot. I throw all kinds of stuff in there. From receipts, instructions manuals and menus, to my personal diary entries (more on that later).</p>

<p>Notes create: 384</p>

<h2>Foursqaure</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve not been using this as much as I wanted to. I think if more friends used it I would use it more. Still I like the idea and I think it&#8217;s going to go places in 2011. </p>

<p>Checkins: 223</p>

<h2>Running</h2>

<p>The most physical of the numbers in this list. I&#8217;ve really got into running this year. I love it. It does not love me. My knees have been quite bad recently so I&#8217;ve had to cut down lots. I use the Nike+ system to monitor my runs. </p>

<p>932.67 miles made of 146 runs.</p>

<p>The graph below shows how the runs were spread out over 2010. I went a bit crazy in the summer.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lecztrWO5H1qawfwr.png"/></p>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p>I use Spotify for music. It&#8217;s worth £10 a month to have access to all that music. I use the iPhone client the most. I have all my Spotify clients scrobble to last.fm. Unfortunately, there is a big gap in the data for the beginning of the year. Sorry.</p>

<p>Tracks listened to: 8580</p>

<p>The graph below shows how the listening is spread out over the year. I&#8217;m not sure what the big spike is. I&#8217;ll look into that and get back to you.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_leczxaYYGe1qawfwr.png"/></p>

<h2>Stackoverflow.com reputation</h2>

<p>2010 saw me join stackoverflow.com. I like the site and had been using it as a spectator for a while. I decided to give something back by depositing my pearls of wisdom. As you can see from the graph I kind of got a little bored. I promise to be more active this year.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_led01oQPi31qawfwr.png"/></p>

<h2>Web Search</h2>

<p>Google can keep track of the web searches that you do. It&#8217;s quite scary, but looking back at the data can be interesting. I don&#8217;t have the tracking on all the machines I use for search, but the graphs below show the lion&#8217;s share. </p>
