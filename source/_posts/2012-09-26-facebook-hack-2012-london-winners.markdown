Last Friday I went to the Facebook London Hack 2012 with [Matt](https://twitter.com/mattjgalloway), [Michael](https://twitter.com/michaelslater), [Will](https://twitter.com/netproteus) and [Steve](https://twitter.com/stephenoldham). Matt's written a nice explanation of what we did on his [blog](http://www.galloway.me.uk/2012/09/facebook-world-hack-london-winners/). In a nutshell we made a Silent Disco Flashmob app called Flash Dance. We had a great time, met lots of cool people and worked in a camper van tent. Even better, we won best overall hack!
