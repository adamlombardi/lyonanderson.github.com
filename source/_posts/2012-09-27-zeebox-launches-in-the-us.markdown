After many months of hard work Zeebox has finally launched in the US. This coincides with a new UK release too. We've added a load of great new features including a What's Hot section, an activity feed to see what you're friends have been doing, and a great new commenting system. Electric Labs has been working with Zeebox since July last year - how time flies! You can grab the UK version [here](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zeebox/id454689266?ls=1&mt=8) and the US version [here](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zeebox/id513267737?ls=1&mt=8).
